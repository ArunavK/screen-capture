A cross platform screen recording tool using the Electron framework

## Acknowledgements

I am making this tool to help me understand the Electron framework better. This completely a learning project, but I do intend to use the final product myself, as I am yet to find a simple screen recorder. The code is based on the screen recorder by [Fireship](https://github.com/fireship-io/223-electron-screen-recorder).

This markdown file (as well as all Markdown files I make) was created using [Typora](https://typora.io/)
