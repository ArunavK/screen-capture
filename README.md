# screen-capture

A cross platform screen recording tool using the Electron framework

## Acknowledgements

I am making this tool to help me understand the Electron framework better. The code is entirely based on the screen recorder by [Fireship](https://github.com/fireship-io/223-electron-screen-recorder). I took help from his [tutorial page](https://fireship.io/lessons/electron-screen-recorder-project-tutorial/) and [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yqDxhR2XxE&t=152s)

This markdown file (as well as all Markdown files I make) was created using [Typora](https://typora.io/)
